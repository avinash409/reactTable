#### Environment

You may use whatever coding environment you would like, though, we will be testing your code with the following:

- Node version 8+ 
- Chrome browser version 60+

#### Grading

**THIS SHOULD BE PRODUCTION LEVEL CODE** 

We will critique on UX and code quality, but not design. Testing your code is not required.

Good luck.
